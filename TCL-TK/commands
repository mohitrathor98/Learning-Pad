TCL Commands
============
Tcl command is actually a list of words, with the first word 
representing the command to be executed. The next words represent the arguments. 
In order to group the words into a single argument, we enclose multiple words
with "" or {}.
The syntax of Tcl command is as follows âˆ’
    commandName argument1 argument2 ... argumentN

EX:

puts "Hello, world!" ==> Here puts is a command and "Hello World" is an argument


Command Substitution
====================
In command substitutions, square brackets are used to evaluate 
the scripts inside the square brackets. 

A simple example to add two numbers is shown below:

puts [expr 1 + 6 + 9]

Variable Substitution
=====================
In variable substitutions, $ is used before the variable name and this returns the contents of the variable. A simple example to set a value to a variable and print it is shown below.

set a 3
puts $a
