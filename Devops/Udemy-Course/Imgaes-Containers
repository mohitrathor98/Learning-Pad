**Finding and Creating Images**

    1. Using pre-built images: Docker hub
        
        docker run node     : Downloads the node image and run it as container
        docker ps -a        : lists all containers
        docker run -it node : Opens an interactive shell to the container 

    2. Creating custom images: Dockerfile

        FROM node # from node image which exist on docker hub - it is a base on which we will build our application

        WORKDIR /app # where to run all the commands in the container

        COPY . /app # codes to be copied which would run on the container
        # first path: path outside the Dockerfile
        # second path: means path inside the image where the path will be copied - here app directory in the root

        RUN npm install # runs any command in the container when image is created

        EXPOSE 80 # expose a port of container to outside env

        # This should be last line of our docker file
        # as we want to start the container after all configs
        CMD ["node", "server.js"] # it runs command when container is created
