What is docker?

    -- Docker is a container tech: A tool for creating and managing containers.

What is a container?

    -- A standardized unit of software
    -- A packaging of code and its dependencies to run that code.
    
    Ex: A Node.js code requires NodeJs runtime, so code and NodeJs dependencies are packaged into a single container.
        -- Now this container can be executed anywhere and it will give same result.
    
Advantage of container:

    -- Development and Production server can have same execution environment.
    -- Multiple projects using different versions of same software can be handled.
