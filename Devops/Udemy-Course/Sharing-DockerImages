It can be done by pushing the docker images to registries.
1. Docker Hub is a public registry and free to use
2. Private registries: stores docker images. Handled by organizations.

Push : docker push <image> || if private reg.: docker push <Host>:<image>
Pull : docker pull <image>

Pushing to docker hub
=====================

1. Sign up and create a repo(image) on docker hub
2. Copy the command to push to the hub
3. Image name to be pushed should be same as repo name
    Ex: docker push morathoe/node-app-practice
    Image name should be morathoe/node-app-practice

4. To rename a pre-existing image: docker tag <old image> <new image>
5. Login to the docker: docker login 
6. Push using command in step 3

Pulling from docker hub
=======================

1. docker pull <image-name> : pulls the latest version of image from docker hub

2. docker run <image-name> : first checks if available locally and if not then pulls from hub.
                             So, if already available then it will run it and not fetch the latest
                             from hub.
