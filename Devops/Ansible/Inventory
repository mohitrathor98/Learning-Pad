==> ping localhost --> to check connectvity

==> ansible all -i 'localhost,' -m ping -c local  --> pinging in ansible
    
    --> -i - Refers to inventory
    --> localhost, - server name, ',' is to specifiy multiple servers
    --> ping - module written in python 
    --> -c - bypassing ssh to work on local 


==> /etc/ansible/hosts --> global inventory file, used across entire system

    sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts  --> it has server ip, domain, group of servers,etc

    create a group:
    [local]  --> group name
    localhost --> server name

==> /etc/ansbile/ansible.cfg --> configuration file

    open it and uncomment inventory and give path to hosts inventory file

==> after doing this, we don't need to specify locahost inventory while pinging in ansbile

    ansible all -m ping -c local

==> in hosts inventory file if we specify one more attribute

    [local]
    localhost ansible_connection=local

    we can specifiy connection type as local.

    Then for pinging:: ansible all -m ping
