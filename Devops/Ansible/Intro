Dependency related to application

Requirement of Ansible:
----------------------
Packages needs to be installed (jre,...)
Services needs to be started (tomcat,...)

To do above things: 
    
    1) We can do manually but it won't be possible if number of servers are in hundreds
    2) We can use shell scripts -- It requires longer learning curve
    3) We can use automation tools like Ansible -- We have to write scripts (YAML) -- User friendly and reliable


Using YAML we preconfiure the server -- Configuration management

-- Ansible will install and create required run time environment for the application.
-- Also, deploys app on server.

-- We write playbook for ansible in YAML format. Using SSH access, ansible pushes playbook on remote server
-- SSH information is present in the inventory file of Ansible.

-- Playbook is a combination of multiple ansible modules designed in python3. So, production server machine must have python3
