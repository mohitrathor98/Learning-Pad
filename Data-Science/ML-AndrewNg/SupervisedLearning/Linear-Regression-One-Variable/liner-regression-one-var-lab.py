# PROBLEM STATEMENT
#
# This lab will use a simple data set with only two data points - a house with 1000 square feet(sqft)
# sold for $300,000 and a house with 2000 square feet sold for $500,000. These two points will constitute
# our data or training set. In this lab, the units of size are 1000 sqft and the units of price are 1000s of dollars.

# Size (1000 sqft)	Price (1000s of dollars)
# 1.0	300
# 2.0	500
# You would like to fit a linear regression model (shown above as the blue straight line) through these two points,
# so you can then predict price for other houses - say, a house with 1200 sqft.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# STEP1 : Create input and output data set : X and Y

# x_train is the input variable (size in 1000 square feet)
# y_train is the target (price in 1000s of dollars)
x_train = np.array([1.0, 2.0])
y_train = np.array([300.0, 500.0])
print(f"x_train = {x_train}")
print(f"y_train = {y_train}")


# STEP2: Find out number of training examples

# m is the number of training examples
# Numpy arrays have a .shape parameter. x_train.shape returns a python tuple with an entry for each dimension
print(f"x_train.shape: {x_train.shape}")
m = x_train.shape[0]
print(f"Number of training examples is: {m}")


i = 0 # Change this to 1 to see (x^1, y^1)
x_i = x_train[i]
y_i = y_train[i]
print(f"(x^({i}), y^({i})) = ({x_i}, {y_i})")

# You can plot these two points using the scatter() function in the matplotlib library, as shown in the cell below.

# The function arguments marker and c show the points as red crosses (the default is blue dots).
# You can use other functions in the matplotlib library to set the title and labels to display

# Plot the data points
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, marker='x', c='r')
# Set the title
plt.title("Housing Prices")
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Price (in 1000s of dollars)')
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Size (1000 sqft)')
plt.show()


# STEP 3: Assume w and b parameters

# As described in lecture, the model function for linear regression (which is a function that maps from x to y) is represented as

# 洧녭洧녻,洧녪(洧논(洧녰))=洧녻洧논(洧녰)+洧녪(1)
#
# The formula above is how you can represent straight lines - different values of  洧녻 and  洧녪
# give you different straight lines on the plot.


# Let's try to get a better intuition for this through the code blocks below. Let's start with  洧녻=100
#   and  洧녪=100
#  .

# Note: You can come back to this cell to adjust the model's w and b parameters
w = 100
b = 100
print(f"w: {w}")
print(f"b: {b}")


# Now, let's compute the value of  洧녭洧녻,洧녪(洧논(洧녰))
# for your two data points. You can explicitly write this out for each data point as -

# for  洧논(0)
#  , f_wb = w * x[0] + b

# for  洧논(1)
#  , f_wb = w * x[1] + b

# For a large number of data points, this can get unwieldy and repetitive. 
# So instead, you can calculate the function output in a for loop as shown in the compute_model_output function below.

# Note: The argument description (ndarray (m,)) describes a Numpy n-dimensional array of shape (m,). (scalar) describes an argument without dimensions, just a magnitude.
# Note: np.zero(n) will return a one-dimensional numpy array with  洧녵 entries

# Try experimenting with different values of  洧녻

# Prediction
# Now that we have a model, we can use it to make our original prediction. Let's predict the price of a house with 1200 sqft. Since the units of  洧논
#   are in 1000's of sqft,  洧논
#   is 1.2.
