Types of Learning
-----------------
    1) Supervised Learning: 
            --  When model is getting trained by labelled datasets.
            --  Labelled dataset is one which have both input and output parameters.

            Based on the datasets we classify supervised learning into two types:
                --> Classification (Defined labels): Discrete data
                --> Regression (No labels Defined): Continous data in a range

    2) Unsupervised Learning:
            --  Target is not given to the model while training 
            --  Traning model has only input parameter values

            Two Types of Unsupervised Learning:
                --> Clustering: This technique is used to group data based on different patterns, that a model finds.
                --> Association: Rule based ML technique, which finds out some very useful relations between parameters of a large data set.

    3) Semi-Supervised Learning:
            --  Few datasets are labelled
            --  We use Unsupervised learning to predict labels for unlabelled data.
            --  Then we feed these labels to supervised learning
            --  Major use of this technique is with image datasets as larges images datasets are not completely labelled

    4) Reinforcement Learning
