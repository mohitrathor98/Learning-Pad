Recursion
---------

    -- A function call itself directly or indirectly
        Direct: fun() calls itself
        Indirect: fun1() calls fun2() and fun2() calls fun1()

    -- Base cases are added to stop recursion at some point


Application of Recursion
------------------------

    1) Many algorithm techniques are based on Recursion
        --> Dynamic Programming
        --> Backtracking
        --> Divide and Conquer(Binary Search, Quick Sort and Merge Sort)

    2) Many problems inherently recursive
        --> Tower of hanoi
        --> DFS based traversals
