Arrays
======
    1) Fixed size arrays
            
            // stack Allocated
            int arr[100]
            int arr[] = {}
            int *arr = new int[10] // Heap Allocated

            In Java, Arrays are always allocated on heap

    2) Dynamic sized arrays
        -- Resized automatically
            
        How it is implemented?
        ----------------------
            --> Intially a size is allocated
            --> When array becomes full
                    -- copy all the elements to a newly allocated array with greater size
            --> start pushing elements again

        Example:
            Vector: C++
            ArrayList: Java
            List: Python
