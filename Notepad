Why to learn GO?
    
    -- Code runs fast
        --> It is a compiled language with features of interpreted language
    
    -- Garbage Collection
        --> Automatic memory management
    
    -- Simpler Objects
        --> Go does not use class
        --> It uses structs with associated memory
        --> No inheritence, No Constructor, No Generics
            - Makes code faster
        
    -- Efficient concurrency
        --> concurrency is the management of multiple tasks at the same time.
        --> Go includes concurrency primitives
            --> Goroutines represent concurrent tasks.
            --> Channels are used to communicate between tasks.
            --> Select enables task synchronization.
