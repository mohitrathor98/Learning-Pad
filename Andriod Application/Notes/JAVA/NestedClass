Nested Class
------------
    --> Subset of an inner class
    --> If the Inner class is "static" ==> it is nested class
    --> We will allocate only one block of memory for the inner class irrespective of number of objects for outer class

        Ex: 
            class Outer{
                int data;

                static class MemberInner{
                    // nested class
                }
            }
