File Handling
-------------
    --> Used to either write or read the content to or from the File
    --> 2 pre-requisite, namely
        1) We must include the 'io' package
        2) We must handle exceptions wither using try...catch block or throws clause

    --> classes within 'io' packages are grouped and characterized as
        1) ByteStream class
                -- We can write only byte data to the file
                -- Developers responsiblity to convert to byte before we write to the file 
                -- Class name ending with "Stream" (i.e. FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, ByteArrayInputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream,
                    BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream, ....)

        2) CharacterStream class
                -- We can write any primitive type data directly to the file
                -- class name ending either with "Reader" or "Writer" (i.e, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, InputStreamReader,
                    BufferedOutputStream, ....)
