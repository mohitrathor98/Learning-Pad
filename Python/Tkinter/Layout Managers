pack()
=====

-- It packs all the commponets consecutively(one after another)
-- It accepts left, right center arguments.

place()
======

-- Precise positioning
-- While placing we can provide an x and y value

for ex:

my_label.place(x=0, y=0) # top left corner

-- We have to work on coordinates for each component as it is precise
-- if we use place then components having pack won't get displayed

grid()
=====

-- It divides screen into cols and rows

eg: my_label.grid(column=0, row=0)

-- it is relative to other component
-- so even if we change it to (column=4, row = 4), label's position won't change
   as no other components are in (0,0),(1,1),(2,2) and so on.

-- can't mixup pack and grid
