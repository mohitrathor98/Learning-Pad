SQLite
======
    --> small, fast and reliable
    --> can run in memory or as a single file
    --> Interact with it using SQL

    --> can only one write operation at a time
    --> allows multiple read operation

Using SQLite in python
======================

    --> import sqlite3

        connection = sqlite3.connect('data.db') # connect to database
        cursor = connection.cursor() # get the cursor 

        cursor.execute('Your SQL Query here') # execute sql Query
        connection.commmit()    # commmit to database
        
        connection.close()

Cursor: All operation in SQLite  are made by cursor, and not by the connection
        object itself

        --> By this we can have one single connection to db but multiple cursors

        --> Once we read row1, cursor moves to row2 and so on
