CSS Box Model
=============
    ==> A box which wraps around every html element.
    ==> Consists of: borders, margins, paddings and the actual content

    --> Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
    --> Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
                - Provides space between content and border

    --> Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
           
    
    --> Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
               - Margin provides space between two different html elements


    div {
        width: 300px;
        border: 15px solid green;
        padding: 50px;
        margin: 20px;
    }

CSS Display Property
====================

    ==> specifies display behaviour of html element
    ==> CSS syntax: display: value;

        value
        -----
            --> block: -- by default some elements are block display.
                       -- it blocks other elements to stay at side of it
                       -- acquires whole width on screen

                       Ex: h1,h2.., <p>, <form>,etc

            --> inline: -- it takes as much of the space it requires no more than that
                        -- height and width properties have no effects.

                        Ex: <span></span>, <a></a>, <img>

            --> inline-block: -- it uses both of the features
                              -- allows element to stay inline and allows changes with height and width properties

            --> none: -- removes element


CSS position properties
=======================

    ==> By default, all html statement are in static position
    ==> css syntax: position: value;

        value
        -----
            --> static: -- Default for elements
                        -- elements are postioned as per the html flow

            --> Relative: -- Positions element realtive to the postion it have been as per static flow
                          -- coordinates: top, bottom, left, right


                        div {
                            position:relative;
                            
                            left:100px;     --> 100 px to the left from the position it would have been if static
                            top:100px;
                        }  

                        -- when element is postioned as per the relative postioning, all other elements are unaffected
                        -- their position remains the same


            --> Absolute: --
