# React Js

    - A javascript library for building user interfaces.
    - Able to breakdown complex web structures into element trees.
    - Able to render only those components which have changes, keeping other
      components of web page as it is.


    Why ReactJS?
    ===========
    - Javascript uses DOM(Document Object Model) to query the elements in the
      page and manipulate it.
    - Now, for large scale apps, this vanilla JS becomes tedious and complex
      to write and maintain.

    -- ReactJS, allows to break web pages into small and reusable components, and
       takes care of creating and updating the DOM elements.
    -- Components helps us write reusable, modular and better organized code.


Local Environment
=================
1. Install npm
2. npx create-react-app <proj-name>
3. cd to proj dir and run "npm start"
