    Why ReactJS?
    ===========
    - Javascript uses DOM(Document Object Model) to query the elements in the 
      page and manipulate it.
    - Now, for large scale apps, this vanilla JS becomes tedious and complex
      to write and maintain.

    -- ReactJS, allows to break web pages into small and reusable components, and 
       takes care of creating and updating the DOM elements.
    -- Components helps us write reusable, modular and better organized code.
